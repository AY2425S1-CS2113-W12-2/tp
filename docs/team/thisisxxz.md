### v1.0 Enhancements: `Allocator` Class

- Allocation Logic Development

  - Developed the backbone of the ``Allocator`` class. Designed an $O(n^2)$ allocation algorithm in FindOurSEP 1.0 version. Wrote JUnit tests for the allocator.
  -  Added corresponding methods (copy constructors, helper methods) in ``Student`` and ``StudentList`` classes to serve the needs of the allocator.

- Allocate Command Bug Fix



### v2.0 Enhancements: `Stats` and ``viewQuota`` commands

- Stats Command Implementation
  - Designed and implemented the ``StatCommand`` class to view statistics of the specified partner universities. In FindOurSEP 2.0 version, this refers to checking the minimum and average GPA of the university. Wrote JUnit tests for this command.
  - Designed and implemented the ``viewQuotaCommand`` class to check the remaining quota of the specified partner universities. Wrote JUnit tests for this command.
