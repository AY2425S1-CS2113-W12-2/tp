## Acknowledgements

This project utilizes the following dependencies:

- [JUnit 5.10.0](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.junit.jupiter/junit-jupiter-api/5.10.0) for testing.
- [AsciiTable 0.3.2](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/de.vandermeer/asciitable/0.3.2) for formatting tables.
- [Jackson Databind 2.18.0](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.fasterxml.jackson.core/jackson-databind/2.18.0) for JSON processing.
- [OpenCSV 5.9](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.opencsv/opencsv/5.9) for CSV parsing.

Many thanks to the developers and maintainers of these libraries for their incredible work. Their efforts have significantly contributed to the success of this project.

## Installation

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- Java 17
- Download the latest `.jar` from [here](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2113-W12-2/tp/releases/tag/v1.0).

### Steps

1. **Copy the `.jar` file:**
    - Move the downloaded `.jar` file into a designated folder on your computer.

2. **Prepare your data file:**
    - If you want to parse a file (.CSV, .JSON, .TXT) containing student data, ensure you have the absolute path ready for that file.

3. **Run the `.jar` file:**
    - Open a terminal.
    - Navigate (`cd`) to the folder containing the `.jar` file.
    - Execute the `.jar` file using the following command:
      ```shell
      java -jar FindOurSEP.jar
      ```


ðŸŽ‰ Congratulations! Youâ€™re all set to dive into the wonders of this project. Enjoy the ride!

### Architecture

### Frontend / User Interface

### Parser

The `Parser` class is a crucial component instantiated as soon as FindOurSEP is initialized. Its responsibility is to process the userâ€™s input into commands and invoking the correct command object for the rest of the program.

Some of its core features include:
- Breaking down user input and extracting the relevant command and data for further processing.
- Provide robust error handling when unknown command is received.
- Validate data parsed in from external file (.CSV, .JSON, .TXT) sources. (Further details in the `Storage` class)

Here is a class diagram highlighting the fundamental structure of the `Parser` class.

![ParserClass](UML_Diagrams/ParserClass.drawio.svg)

How `Parser` works:
1. Whenever the user enters an input, the input will be directed to the `Parser` class's `parseInput()` method. 
2. Within the method, the command will be extracted and the appropriate `XYZCommand` object (XYZCommand is a placeholder for various commands such as DeleteCommand, ListCommand, etc.) will be instantiated.
3. Upon instantiation, the `XYZCommand` is prepared for execution. Each `XYZCommand` class, inheriting from the abstract `Command` class, has a `run()` method that executes its specific instructions.

The sequence diagram below demonstrates the interactions within the `Parser` component when a user inputs the command: `add id/A1234567I gpa/5.0 p/{13,61,43}`.

![ParserSequence](UML_Diagrams/ParserSequence.drawio.svg)

The boolean return value of `parseInput()` indicates whether the user has chosen to continue or terminate the program. A `true` value keeps FindOurSEP running, while a `false` value ends the program.
